# Hot-Standby-Routing-Protocol
This is a lab for hot stand routing protocol(HSRP) which is gateway redundancy protocol, in a network if the default gateway is down then the host won't be able to go out of the network, so here we have to configure virtual gateway at the host side. Here there can be three default gateway states active, standy and listen state.
